      <p>Food Hub services came into existence as an innovative approach by two IIT graduate students, Tina and James,
      in 2010. The restaurant offers a sophisticated yet totally ethnic experience where the display kitchen is part of the restaurant. In Food Hub, while dining, guests
      are given checked aprons and are encouraged to eat with their hands to experience the food through all their senses.</p>
      <p>In 2011,Tine and James decided to expand their  business across the country. </p><br>
      <p>At present, Food Hub restaurants has their branches across the country and became a well-known brand in
      Indian cuisine restaurants.</p>
